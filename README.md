### Writeup
1. - The challenges I faced was getting the access to MongoDb and retrieving the data before rendering anything. Often time, storing proper data to mongoDB and fetch the data is confusing and painful.
2. - I would focusing on using some front-end framework to complete this assignment. As I am very comfortable with using current HTML/CSS already. Challenge myself and using framework would be a big step for me.
3. - My assumption is that the mongoDB should be storing users' passwords securely. In many ways, I don't think if we should store users' passwords to mongoDB for security issue, but I may be overthinking.
4. - About an entire week, having troubles with setting up mongoDB, storing url/passwords, fetching data etc.
